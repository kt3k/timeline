Almost 3 years in Deno Land. It's still very challenging to work here partially because of language problem and partially because of extremely high expectations in members performance.

I tend to think a hard job is a good job. So I like this job.

My ears are much better at hearing English these days, compared to the days before Deno. I can hear people very well when I was able to focus on the speaker very well. Now the problem is that it's a bit difficult to focus long time on the speaker. It's just too tiring. But I feel it's matter of time that I make progress on that.
