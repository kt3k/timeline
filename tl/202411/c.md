It's sometimes fun to swim in some mud in the world, but ultimately you cannot be in the mud forever. You can't follow or pursue the mud eternally as they ultimately have no value in themselves. Your desire to any kinds of mud eventually becomes weaker and weaker as you get tired of them, and that time will definitely come as any mud is certainly mud, not diamond, not gold.
